  title: Getting Around Town?
  body: How do you get around town? Do you do this or that? Sometimes you can take a bus or a car. Riding the subway or train is also an option. You need a ticket for this or you have to pay cash. Riding public transportation allows you to read a book.

  title: Using Grubhub
  body: Using grubhub is pretty good compared to having to call around to places. It gives you up to date information, let's you pay with a card and avoids bad reception on a cell phone, thick accents when ordering from ethnic restaurants, or just general interaction with a person.
