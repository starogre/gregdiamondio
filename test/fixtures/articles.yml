one:
  title: Getting Around Town?
  body: How do you get around town? Do you do this or that? Sometimes you can take a bus or a car. Riding the subway or train is also an option. You need a ticket for this or you have to pay cash. Riding public transportation allows you to read a book.

two:
  title: Using Grubhub
  body: Using grubhub is pretty good compared to having to call around to places. It gives you up to date information, let's you pay with a card and avoids bad reception on a cell phone, thick accents when ordering from ethnic restaurants, or just general interaction with a person.

three:
  title: Amazon
  body: Amazon is pretty great. I buy lots of things on there. You can buy soap, food, laundry detergent, books, electronics, paper...just about anything with free shipping. Their prices are always competitive and usually the best, since resellers can use the site. They are kind of scary though, because they're driving out competitors.

four:
  title: Dota 2
  body: Dota 2, pretty great game. Lots of strategies and thought go into everything. It's very addictive though and the community can be quite toxic. Ultimately I stopped playing because of this, but I loved watching the International 5.
