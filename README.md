[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/diamond29/gregdiamondio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diamond29/gregdiamondio)

I'm using it to learn web development/ruby on rails, so it sees occasional updates as I think of new things to try.

### Requirements
  1. Postgresql database
  2. Ruby - currently developing with 2.2.2
  3. Bundler gem
  4. Possibly more?

### Run a local copy
  1. git clone https://github.io/diamond29/gregdiamondio.git
  2. cd gregdiamondio
  3. bundle install
  4. bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
  5. bundle exec rails server
  6. Visit localhost:3000 in a browser.
  7. Visit localhost:3000/login and log in with credentials 
  {user: admin@admin.com, pwd: admin} to see site functionality as a user/admin.

### Usage
Log in, make blog posts. That's about it for now - more to come.
